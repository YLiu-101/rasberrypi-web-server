# Bouncing Balls Web Server in Java

## Features

- A custom-built web server using Java's networking capabilities.
- Displays an animated bouncing balls scene on the web browser.
- Configurable number of balls and their properties (e.g., color, size).
- Written in pure Java without external web frameworks.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher.
- A web browser that supports HTML5 (for rendering the animation).
